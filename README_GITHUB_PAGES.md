# Publish Customer Info App to GitHub Pages

1. Create a new GitHub repository (public or private with Pages enabled).
2. Commit the `index.html` file in the repository root.
3. In the repository settings -> Pages, select the `main` branch and `/ (root)` folder, then save.
4. Wait a minute — your site will be available at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>`.

Notes:
- If you prefer a custom domain, configure it in Pages settings and add DNS records.
- For private repos, enable GitHub Pages for the repo and choose the appropriate access.

Local testing:
- Open `index.html` in a browser to test locally.

Security:
- Do not include sensitive data in the repo. Admin settings should be entered per-customer after hosting.
